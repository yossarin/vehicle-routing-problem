Ant Colony Optimization pseudocode
==================================

ACO pseudocode for solving multiple depot vehicle routing problem.

Adjustable parameters are in stars, e.g. *alpha*.

repeat max-iterations:
    # Generate *m* feasible solutions.
    repeat *m*:
        solutions += generate-solution(*alpha*, *beta*, pheromones)
    # Generate new solutions from existing by mutating each with *mut-prob*.
    mutations = mutate-solutions(*mut-prob*, solutions)
    # Find best among all current solutions.
    current-best = find-best(mutations, solutions)
    # Update pheromones according to current best solution.
    update-pheromones(*decay-rate*, *deposit-rate*, pheromones, current-best)
    # Set all time best
    if current-best < best:
        best = current-best

fn generate-solution(*alpha*, *beta*, pheromones):
    until visited-all(visited)
      # Start new route if current truck has unsufficient cargo.
      next-city = probability-select(*alpha*, *beta*, pheromones)
      visited += next-city
    return best-2-opt-exchange(visited)
